3. Dessert
Five course meal

Payment and receipt processing methods


Functional programming
----------------------
It's a programming paradigm that builds structure and elements of a program and
 avoids changing states.

Example
A voting system program, the registration function that contains different
attributes can be user to collect data in different regions of the country
instead of having different registration functions. Also the online voting
papers can be under one function say cast_vote_form which can be used on other
voting instances.
